        <li>2 1/2 c all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F. Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. 
            Add the butter and mix with a well till fine granules (easiest way is with 
            an electric mixer). Then add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Finally add the cream, honey, and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness. Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the 
            dough to a cookie sheet.Criss-cross each square from corner-to-corner with a knife, 
            lightly (not cutting through the dough).</li>
        <li>Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.</li>

        <li>Let cool completely before eating, this bread tastes better room temperature and dry. Also for more flavor you can add more cinnamon or other spices.</li>
    </ol>
